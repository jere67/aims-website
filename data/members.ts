    bio: "I am a PhD student advised by Professors Brian Kiedrowski and Majdi Radaideh. My background is in transport methods with Monte Carlo neutral particle transport development work on OpenMC , Shift, and MC - Hammer, as well as deterministic method research in tensor network methods for PDEs and reduced order modeling. Within the AIMS group, I lead the development of pyMAISE, our group's Python - based automatic ML library, and maintain our two cl usters. My research career began here in Prof. Kiedrowski ’ s transport research group during my undergrad, which branched into AIMS with the development of pyMAISE in my senior design course. Outside of research, I enjoy biking, volleyball, reading, and watching bike racing and F1.",

    bio: "A first honors nuclear engineer graduate of King Abdulaziz University and the top‑ranked student in the Faculty of Engineering, with a background in radiation detection, software developments, and machine learning. My undergraduate research focused on designing and optimizing radiation detection systems, and development of novel algorithms for localizing sealed radioactive sources, culminating in a paper publication in Springer Nature (2024). Beyond nuclear applications, I have tackled AI‑driven projects such as multimodal detection of the red palm weevil and building a regulatory‑compliance chatbot. I am currently pursuing graduate studies with the goal of applying reinforcement learning, large language models, and other ML techniques to next‑generation nuclear energy systems and intelligent radiation monitoring solutions. Passionate about both research and community involvement, I have volunteered in numerous events and clubs, while also participating in various competitions.",
